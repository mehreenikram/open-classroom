# open-classroom
This project includes data mining tasks, on the traces of a French online learning website openclassrooms.com/. The purpose was to mine the studentâ€™s learning behavior, for a specific course and observe any unnatural behavior in following the lectures. Later present these statistics to the course instructor in order to help him reorganize, the course structure or the contents, better.
